The fourth year of an integrated masters degree requires students to work in groups of four on a challenging project which is typically based on an idea from an industrial partner. Our project will design and implement a booking system to be installed into the offices of JPMorgan. The system will utilise tablet devices attached to the outside of meeting rooms to show ‘at a glance’ the availability of rooms and allow members of staff to ‘check in’ to the room they have booked. The application will additionally allow the ‘instant booking’ of rooms that are currently available.
