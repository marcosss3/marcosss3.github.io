    <p>Hello, my name is Marcos.</p>

    <p>I am a 21 year old undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Although my education focuses on software development, I consider myself to be a hybrid designer developer.</p>

    <p>My personal interests lie within the areas of user interface design, user experience, data visualisation and even graphic design.</p>

    <p>I made this website to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on.</p>
