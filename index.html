    <p>Hello, I am a hybrid designer developer based in London.</p>
      
    <p>I joined Deloitte Digital after graduating from the University of Southampton, where I completed a Master's in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>My personal interests lie within the areas of user interface design, user experience, data visualisation and even graphic design.</p>

    <p>I created this website to showcase some of the <a href="/{{ site.baseurl }}portfolio">projects</a> that I have worked on. It is built with Jekyll and uses the Hyde theme, created by Mark Otto.</p>
